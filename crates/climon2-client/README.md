# climon2-client

The version-matched terminal bridge. Its frozen invocation is:

```text
<executable home>/<version>/climon2-client attach --metadata <absolute path>
```

`run(arguments: impl IntoIterator<Item = OsString>) -> Result<u32, Error>`
excludes argv[0]. `Error` exposes `code`, `message`, and optional absolute `logs`.
The thin binary prints one diagnostic after all terminal guards have dropped.
`CLIMON2_HOME` and `CLIMON2_LOG` are configuration inputs from the environment;
the command's environment is never used for internal descriptors.

Every invocation writes its own session log,
`<home>/logs/<session-id>/client-<UTC YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>-<pid>.log`, created
`0600` with `create_new` and `O_NOFOLLOW`. No client truncates, deletes, shares
or reopens another client's log, so concurrent and later clients of one session
never collide; a collision would be an ordinary I/O failure. Failures after the
log exists carry the ` (logs: <session-log directory>)` suffix.

Connection, hello write, and complete hello reply share one real two-second
deadline. Peers must have the effective UID and hello must match session,
protocol, metadata version, and attach capability. Raw mode begins only after
the daemon accepts Attach. A controller waits for Granted, writes the
restoration and live backlog, drains input typed during restoration, then sends
Ready; application input is admitted only after that confirmation. Observers
can take control, and Ctrl+] followed by `d` requests an explicit detach.

The event loop has one incremental incoming frame, one pending Input/Resize
frame, and one pending Output payload. Core validates framing; no payload
exceeds 65,535 bytes. Socket or terminal backpressure stops the corresponding
producer. A pending detach or lost-session result has a bounded five-second
confirmation deadline, including while terminal output is blocked.

SIGWINCH is coalesced and unchanged sizes are suppressed. HUP/TERM/INT close
the socket and return 128+signal. Stdin EOF/EIO silently returns 129. Ctrl-C,
Ctrl-Z, binary bytes and all terminal control sequences are forwarded unchanged.
Exit is read only after pending output drains. Termios and nonblocking flags
are restored on normal exit, errors, signals, and unwinding. Leave policy
belongs exclusively to the daemon.

The daemon's release bytes return the terminal to its normal-shell baseline. A
shown placeholder is ended below itself (cursor to the last row, CR LF) on Exit,
Detached and Error, and with one non-blocking attempt on a termination signal.
Only when no daemon response arrives (unexpected connection loss, or the
five-second deadline expiring) does the client write its conservative reset:
synchronized update ended, `CSI 0 m`, cursor shown, mouse, focus and bracketed
paste off, application cursor keys and keypad off. It never leaves the
alternate screen blindly, so alternate-screen and other unknown state (for
example the title) cannot be restored without a daemon response. On expiry
pending output is discarded and the reset gets one non-blocking attempt.

## Behavioral evidence

`tests/bridge.rs` drives the real binary on real PTYs with local protocol peers:

  `/bin/sh` session leader with SIGTTIN/SIGTTOU ignored, so reads fail with EIO)
- `attach_refusal_or_unexpected_reply_fails_without_raw_mode`
- `hung_up_session_during_blocked_output_sleeps_then_delivers_everything` (bounds

The fault injections exist only with `test-hooks`. `CLIMON2_CLIENT_FAULT=panic`
panics after entering raw mode. `CLIMON2_CLIENT_FAULT=hold-attach` with
`CLIMON2_CLIENT_HOLD=<path>` waits, at most 4 s (inside the daemon's 5 s
initial-attachment deadline), for that file to exist before sending `Attach`, so
tests can produce session output before the first restoration.
The panic hook logs a static event, never payloads, argv or environment values.
Tests create isolated files under the project and never run nested Cargo builds.
Restoration assertions compare all configuration flags, control characters and
speeds; Darwin's kernel-managed transient `PENDIN` flag is not configuration.
They also compare the terminal's file-status flags (`F_GETFL`, e.g. `O_NONBLOCK`)
for stdin's and stdout's open-file descriptions; Darwin's kernel-private
`FWASWRITTEN` bit (set by any write, not settable) is not configuration.
